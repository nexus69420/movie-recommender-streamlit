#  Movie Recommendation System (Hybrid: Content + Collaborative)

This project is a movie recommender system that suggests movies based on both:
- **What the movie is about** (using text-based content)
- **What users with similar preferences liked** (using user ratings)

It uses TMDB and MovieLens data to deliver more accurate and personalized movie recommendations. The system is built with Python and has a web interface using Streamlit.
